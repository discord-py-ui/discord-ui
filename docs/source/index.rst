discord-message-components documentation!
=======================================================

Welcome to the discord message components docs!
This is a "extension" (I guess) or whatever you want to call it for `discord.py <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`__

We (`Redstone <https://github.com/RedstoneZockt>`__ and me) decided to create a pip package for the 
new message components, until discord.py v2.0 is out

We got some cool features for you like:

.. note::

   *  Sending buttons and select menus very easy
   *  Receiving their interaction
   *  Responding to their interacion

   and some more things
